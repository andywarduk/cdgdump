What is it?
===========

This program can be used to view CD+G files (.cdg) but it's real use is converting cdg file + audio to video. CD+G is most commonly used on karaoke CDs where graphical lyrics are stored in the CD subchannels R to W.


Building
========

To build this you need the SDL, libpng and zlib development stuff. On my platform of choice (Fedora) this is a matter of doing:

sudo yum -y install sdl-devel libpng-devel zlib-devel

If you've checked this out from cvs then do the following first:

make -f Makefile.cvs

Now it's time to configure the build. To see available options do:

./configure --help

If you're happy with the defaults, just do:

./configure

If that succeeds:

make
sudo make install

That should be it!
